Mapping storms and severe weather events across continental U.S.

This is one of my grad school projects, completed in a Data Visualization course spring of 2024. I explored the impacts of severe weather events in the continental US using NOAAâ€™s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) data.
I mapped storm damage (monetary, injury, deaths, etc.) by state, county, density, and also created interactive density and cluster maps to explore impacts of each weather event. Lastly, I took a sample of the severe weather events dataset and identified the nearest large city, exploring relationship between impact and nearest large city population.
